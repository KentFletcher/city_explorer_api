# city_explorer_api
Lab 06-09: back-end

**Author**: Kent Sheats

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We are building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end, which was provided for us. We will request data from a total of six third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

1. data directory - containing geo.json and darksky.json
2. .env - with your PORT. Make sure this file is in your .gitignore.
3. README.md - with documentation regarding your lab and its current state of development. Check the "documentation"  section below for more details on how that should look AT MINIMUM
4. .gitignore - with standard NodeJS configurations
5. .eslintrc.json - with Code 301 course standards for the linter
6. package.json - with all dependencies and any associated details related to configuration. The dependencies needed include: express, dotenv, and cors.
7. Note that the package-lock.json file is automatically created when dependencies are installed and ensures that future installations of the project use the same versions of the dependencies.
8. Deploy your basic express server to Heroku.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
- Languages used: Javascript
- Libraries and frameworks: Node.js, Express
- Deployment platform: Heroku
- Repository Host: GitHub
- APIs: LocationIQ, Weatherbit

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
-->
04-14-2020 Set up repository and file structure, initial server set up, launched site via Heroku, built constructor functions for location and weather.
